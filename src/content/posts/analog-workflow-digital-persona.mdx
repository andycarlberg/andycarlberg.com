I live behind a screen. I build software. I work with remote teams. I'm glued to my phone as much
as anyone. When it comes to organization, the digital tools designed to meet us where we're at have
a fatal flaw: They are too easy to ignore. You can’t lose a Trello board behind a GitHub tab if the
board is a physical wall in your office.

Coming off a long client project, I realized my "high-availability" digital system was actually
high-friction and low-visibility. I needed a system that stayed in my face and removed the "out of
sight, out of mind" tax on my focus.

## The Basis: Getting Things Done

I’ve used GTD for years. The "mind like water" philosophy resonates because, in my world, if a task
isn't logged, it doesn't exist. My life runs on Google Task reminders, but my strategy was getting
buried.

I tried Obsidian. I tried Trello. I tried automation. They all failed because they lacked **tactile
presence**. Now, I’ve covered a blank wall in my office with sticky notes. It’s the first thing I see
when I walk in. It’s a radiator of information that I can’t minimize.

## The Schema

I’m not revolutionizing the workflow; I’m just making it **impossible to dodge**. Left-to-right, the
wall mirrors a standard pipeline:

* **FUTURE**: Cold storage for ideas that aren't a priority.
* **INBOX**: The landing zone for fleeting ideas.
* **ACTIVE**: The WIP (Work In Progress). Limit 3–5 projects max.
* **HOLD**: Async dependencies.

I don’t over-document. I only write the very next action. This reduces the documentation load and
forces agility. If a project is waiting on someone else, it moves to "HOLD" to free up a slot. It’s
a physical representation of system throughput.

## The Hardware: Tickler Files and Daily Notes

For tasks that aren't "now" but have a "when," I use a 3"x5" index card Tickler File. It’s a set of
43 dividers (31 days, 12 months) that contains sticky notes and index cards. Since most of my work
is digital, these aren't projects or tasks themselves; they're "pointers." The "pointer" tells me
exactly which digital resource needs an update and when. It’s a **physical calendar with a digital
backup**.

For the day-to-day grind, I’ve adopted a disc-bound notebook. This is my high-speed scratchpad.

* **The Daily Note**: I start each morning by identifying the top 1–3 high-impact tasks.
* **The Scratchpad**: A catch-all for meeting notes and fleeting thoughts.
* **The Timesheet**: The left margin acts as a manual log, making it easy to reconcile billable time
  into our digital tools later without "guessing" where the day went.

## The "Harvest"

The lynchpin of this system is the evening shutdown. For a WFH professional, this is the **literal
firewall** between "Work" and "Home."

* **Clear the cache**: Review the day’s paper notes. Transcribe what matters to the digital source
  of truth; shred the rest.
* **Update the wall**: Ensure every active project has a clear requirement for tomorrow.
* **Shut it down**: Close the tabs. Clear the desk. Make sure we have a "mind like water".

## Why this works

When I'm away from the desk, I still use digital tools like Google Keep. But the "Harvest" ensures
that mobile data is synced back to the physical command center.

By moving from a digital system that gets lost to a physical one that doesn't, I’ve engineered out
the cognitive load of "searching for work." I don't look for my tasks anymore. **They’re just
there** - guarding my focus so I can spend it on the work that actually moves the needle.
