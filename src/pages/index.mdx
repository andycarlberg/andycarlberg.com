I'm **Andy Carlberg**, Technology Leader.

# I build **living digital products** that respond to your needs instead of ignoring them.

I'm moving the enterprise **beyond the 'Project' mindset**. I combine **technical integrity** with 
**strategic oversight** to create **high-agency teams** and **architectures that evolve** alongside your 
business.

<small>I also write about **personal finance**, **homelab infrastructure**, and the strategic use
of **narrative and communication**.</small>
