# I'm Here to Fix Your Tech Chaos

I'm **Andy Carlberg** and I operate as a **Digital Strategist** - the person you call when your
technology is complex, your strategy is messy, and your budget needs a serious reality check.

I have a **BS in Computer Science** <small>(University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign)</small> and an
**MBA** <small>(University of Iowa)</small>. This isn't just paper - it means I can debate data
structures with your Principal Engineer while simultaneously designing the quarter's strategic KPIs
 with your VP of Marketing. I’m here to bridge that gap, ensuring your high-level plans translate
into reliable systems at scale.

## My Expertise: Strategic Friction Removal

I live to **remove roadblocks**. I specialize in diagnosing the friction and frustration that holds
great teams back and prevents smooth, efficient progress.

If I hear "it is what it is," I ask "why does it have to be?" I leverage my deep **Agile** and
**Scrum** expertise to design and implement the right **systems, processes, and tools**. This
eliminates that **organizational complacency** and drives **fundamental change**.

### My track record proves this approach

* I've successfully implemented and scaled efficient structures **from the ground up** at
**multi-billion** dollar firms, turning chaotic environments into
**predictable, high-output systems**.

* I architect the entire solution, managing technology that serves **millions of users** across
**B2B, B2C, and regulated sectors** (Finance, Healthcare, Consumer Goods) - guaranteeing that
technology and strategy are finally working together.

### Outside the Firewall: Systems and Strategy

I'm wired for systems, even off the clock. My personal life reinforces the discipline and strategic
thinking I bring to my professional roles:

* **Tinkering:** My technical curiosity never sleeps. I'm a dedicated **homelab enthusiast and
self-hoster**, always playing with infrastructure and optimization.
* **Value:** I channel my business acumen into my writing on **personal finance** — always
focused on **defining goals, measuring progress, and executing a disciplined, long-term strategy**.
* **Communication:** My interest in analyzing **film and narrative structure** informs how I
present information. If I can break down a three-act structure, I can certainly package a complex
technical strategy into a clear, compelling story for executive teams.

If you’re interested in exploring how to remove organizational friction and elevate your digital
strategy, let’s connect for a discussion.
