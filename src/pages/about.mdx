# I build products that refuse to become legacy software — or a drain on your capital

I’m **Andy Carlberg**. I ensure technology remains a strategic asset rather than a compounding
liability. With a **BS in Computer Science** (UIUC) and an **MBA** (Iowa), I bridge the gap between
the **Boardroom** and the **Backlog**. I speak the language of IRR and EBITDA, but I live in the
reality of CI/CD and system integrity.

## My Philosophy: Product Stewardship

I don't believe in the "rebuild every three years" cycle. That isn't progress; it’s a failure of
governance. I specialize in **Value Protection** by designing architectures and organizationa
structures that prevent technical debt from eating your margins.

I move organizations beyond reactive "fixing" by implementing **High-Agency environments**. I lead
teams that don't just close tickets; they own the long-term health and resilience of the systems
they build.

### A Track Record of Integrity at Scale

* **Governance as a Feature:** I’ve established resilient technical guardrails at **multi-billion
dollar firms**, transforming chaotic, reactive departments into sustainable, high-output engines.
* **Global Resilience:** I architect solutions serving **millions of users** across highly
regulated sectors- including Finance, Healthcare, and Consumer Goods - ensuring that technical
execution never compromises organizational strategy.

### Outside the Firewall: Systems and Strategy

My drive for optimization doesn't stop at the office. I’m drawn to systems that reward discipline
and well-modeled logic:

* **Tinkering (Homelab):** I maintain a self-hosted infrastructure stack as a private
laboratory. It’s a space for pure experimentation - automated, resilient, and entirely under my own
governance. It’s where I test the limits of what a lean, well-architected system can do.
* **Value (Personal Finance):** I view capital with a long-term, "buy-it-for-life" mindset. To me,
managing a portfolio is the ultimate exercise in stewardship - balancing risk, avoiding the
"interest" of poor decisions, and ensuring every asset serves a future purpose.
* **Strategy (Board Games):** I’m fascinated by games that model complex mechanics - like resource
scarcity in *Power Grid* or the intricate engine-building in *Gizmos*. I enjoy the challenge of
analyzing a game’s "state," identifying the most efficient path forward, and seeing how small
mechanical shifts impact the long-term endgame.

If you’re ready to move past the "fixer" cycle and move toward true **Product Stewardship**, let’s
talk.
