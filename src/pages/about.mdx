# I build products that refuse to become legacy software - or a drain on your capital.

I'm **Andy Carlberg** and and I ensure technology remains an asset rather than a liability. With a
**BS in Computer Science** <small>(University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign)</small> and an **MBA** 
<small>(University of Iowa)</small>, I bridge the gap between the **Boardroom** and the **Backlog**, 
ensuring your high-level plans translate into reliable systems at scale.

## My Philosophy: Engineering for Longevity

I specialize in **Value Protection**. I design architectures and lead teams that prevent the  
expensive "rebuild cycles" that drain enterprise capital. 

I move organizations beyond "it is what it is" by implementing **High-Agency structures**. 
I leverage deep **Agile** expertise to ensure your systems, processes, and tools are 
built for evolution, not just the next deadline.

### A Track Record of Scalable Stewardship

* **Enterprise Governance:** I've established resilient technical structures from the ground up 
at **multi-billion dollar firms**, transforming unpredictable projects into **sustainable, 
high-output systems**.

* **Global Impact:** I architect solutions serving **millions of users** across 
regulated sectors - including Finance, Healthcare, and Consumer Goods - guaranteeing 
that technology and strategy work as a single unit.

### Outside the Firewall: Systems and Strategy

I’m wired for optimization. My personal life reinforces the discipline I bring to my roles:

* **Tinkering**: I use **self-hosted infrastructure** and automation to pressure-test the systemic 
guardrails that allow teams to move fast without breaking things.

* **Value:** I treat **personal finance** with a long-term, disciplined mindset — recognizing that 
"technical debt" is just another form of high-interest loan that eats up capital.

* **Communication**: I analyze **film and narrative structure** to better package complex technical 
strategies into clear, compelling stories for executive teams.

If you’re interested in exploring how to achieve true **Product Stewardship** and 
elevate your digital strategy, let’s connect.
